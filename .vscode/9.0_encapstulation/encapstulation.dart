/*
1. Dart doesnâ€™t support keywords like public, private, and protected. Dart uses _ (underscore) to make a property or method private. The encapsulation happens at library level, not at class level.

2. In this example, we will create a class named Employee. The class will have two private properties _id and _name. We will also create two public methods getId() and getName() to access the private properties. We will also create two public methods setId() and setName() to update the private properties.
